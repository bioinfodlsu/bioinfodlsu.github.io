### FAQs

Q: Do I need to know a lot of biology? <br>
A: It helps, but we can design projects for you that need only the very basic understanding of biology.

Q: But I took up computer science to escape biology... <br>
A: You are biology. You can't escape biology.

Q: Can I do a short internship at the lab? <br>
A: Any meaningful research project takes at least a year or two from start to publication/conference presentation. We prefer students who are willing to go the full length.
