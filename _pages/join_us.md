### Join Us!
Are you searching for a laboratory for your undergraduate or graduate thesis project?

You might be a good fit, if you match some of these criteria:
- Energetic, driven, and curious to investigate the biological mechanisms around us
- Passionate in coding to develop software, pipelines, or even machine learning models
- Eager to analyze trends and patterns in data that explain biological phenomena
- Keen interest in improving hardware performance for bioinformatics algorithms
- Willingness to explore machine learning to solve biological problems


Please go through our [projects](/projects), our [publications](/publications), and our [Github repository](http://github.com/bioinfodlsu){:target="\_blank"}. \\
This [guide](https://bioinfodlsu.com/bioinfodlsu-survival-guide/intro.html){:target="\_blank"} for members and applicants might also be helpful in getting to know the lab. <br> <br>
If the lab interests you, please reach out to us at : anish.shrestha --atmark-- dlsu.edu.ph .

### Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do I need to know a lot of biology? <br>
A: It is fine to have no prior knowledge on biology, but having some basic background on it would be great.

Q: But I took up computer science to escape biology... <br>
A: You *are* biology. You can’t escape biology; there’s cells inside of you growing and dividing as you’re reading this text right now!

Q: What are some references that I could use to get started on bioinformatics? <br>
A: You may view our [survival guide](https://bioinfodlsu.com/bioinfodlsu-survival-guide/intro.html) to see what resources you can use to get started on learning bioinformatics.

Q: What programming languages do we need to know for bioinformatics? <br>
A: Python and R are usually used in this field, but any language works depending on the type of project you are creating (software, web application, pipeline, etc.).

Q: What are some research projects that I could do for my thesis? <br>
A: You may view our [projects](/projects) and [publications](/publications) page to see what type of research projects we have done so far that may interest you.

Q: Does the laboratory hold regular meetings? <br>
A: Yes! We hold weekly hour-long meetings for any announcements and have members present their progress on their research projects.

Q: Can I do a short internship at the lab? <br>
A: Any meaningful research project takes at least a year or two from start to publication or conference presentation. We prefer students who are willing to go the full length.
